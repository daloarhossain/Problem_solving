Problem Statement 73:

You will be given a string, S, as input. Take this input in the main function. Next, write a function named is_palindrome() that will receive this string. Return type of that function will be integer. The function checks whether the string is a palindrome or not. If it is a palindrome, return 1; otherwise, return 0. Receive this value in the main function and, with the help of that value, print "Palindrome" or "Not Palindrome".

Palindrome: A palindrome is a word that reads the same forward and backward.

Input Format
Input will contain the string S.

Constraints
1 <= |S| <= 1000; Here |S| means the length of the string.

Output Format
Output "Palindrome" or "Not Palindrome" without the quotation marks.
