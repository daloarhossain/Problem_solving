Problem 60: Palindrome Array
time limit per test 1 second
memory limit per test 256 megabytes

Given a number N and an array A of N numbers. Determine if it's palindrome or not.

**Note:**
An array is called palindrome if it reads the same backward and forward.
For example, arrays {1} and {1, 2, 3, 2, 1} are palindromes, while arrays {1, 12} and {4, 7, 5, 4} are not.

**Input**
First line contains a number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁵), the number of elements.
Second line contains N numbers (1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10⁹).

**Output**
Print "YES" (without quotes) if A is a palindrome array, otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

**Examples**

Input
5
1 3 2 3 1

Output
YES

Input
4
1 2 3 4

Output
NO
