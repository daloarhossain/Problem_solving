**Problem 39: Remove Element from Array**

**Problem Statement**
You will be given a positive integer **N** and an array **A** of size **N**.
After that, you will be given an index **X**.
You need to **remove** the element at index **X** from the array and print the final array.

**Note:**
Index starts from **0**.
After removing an element, all the remaining elements should be shifted to the left automatically.

**Input Format**

* The first line will contain **N** — the size of the array.
* The second line will contain **N** space-separated integers — the elements of the array **A**.
* The third line will contain the integer **X** — the index of the element to remove.

---

**Output Format**
Print the final array after removing the element, with spaces between elements.

**Constraints**
1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁵
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1000
0 ≤ X < N

**Sample Input 0**
5
10 20 30 40 50
2

**Sample Output 0**
10 20 40 50

**Sample Input 1**
4
1 2 3 4
0

**Sample Output 1**
2 3 4

**Explanation 0**
The element at index **2** is **30**, which is removed.
So, the new array becomes **10 20 40 50**.
