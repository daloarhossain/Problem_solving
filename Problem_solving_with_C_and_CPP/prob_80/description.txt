Problem 80: Mirror Array
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

Given two numbers N and M and a 2D array of size N * M. Print the inverted array that appears in the mirror.

Input
First line contains two numbers N, M (1 ≤ N, M ≤ 100).
N denotes number of rows and M denotes number of columns.
Each of the next N lines will contain M numbers (1 ≤ Ai,j ≤ 10⁹).

Output
Print the inverted array.

Example

Input
3 3
2 3 5
7 9 20
35 1 12
