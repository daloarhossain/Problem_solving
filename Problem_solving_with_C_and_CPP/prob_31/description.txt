**Problem 31: Sum Sum**
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

You will be given a positive integer N and then N numbers.
You need to calculate and print the **sum of positive numbers** and the **sum of negative numbers**, separated by a space.

**Input**
First line will contain an integer N.
Second line will contain N integers named V.

**Constraints**
1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁵
−1000 ≤ V ≤ 1000

**Output**
Print two integers — the sum of positive numbers first, followed by the sum of negative numbers.
