Problem 37: Summation

Problem Statement
You will be given an integer N and an array A containing N integers.
Your task is to calculate the absolute summation of all numbers in the array.

Absolute value means removing any negative sign in front of a number.
For example:
|−5| = 5, |7| = 7

Input Format

The first line contains a number N, the number of elements.

The second line contains N integers representing the array A.

Output Format
Print the absolute summation of all the numbers.

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁵
−10⁹ ≤ A[i] ≤ 10⁹

Sample Input 0
4
7 2 1 3

Sample Output 0
13

Sample Input 1
3
−1 2 −3

Sample Output 1
2

Explanation 1
Sum = (−1 + 2 + −3) = −2 → |−2| = 2
Hence, the output is 2.
