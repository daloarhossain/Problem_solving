Problem 63: Count the Length
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

You are given a string S. Your task is to print the length of the string.

The string may contain letters, digits, and spaces, but it will not contain newline characters inside.

Input
The first line contains an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.
Each of the following T lines contains a string S (1 ≤ |S| ≤ 1000), where |S| is the length of the string.

Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the length of the string S.

Example

Input
4
hello
codeforces
this is c
1234567890

Output
5
10
9
10

Explanation

1. "hello" has 5 characters.
2. "codeforces" has 10 characters.
3. "this is c" includes spaces, so total characters = 9.
4. "1234567890" has 10 characters.
