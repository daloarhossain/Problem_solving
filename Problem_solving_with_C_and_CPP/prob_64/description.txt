Problem 64:

You are given two strings S1, S2 and two integers — start and end.
Your task is to take the characters from the second string (S2), starting at index **start** and ending at index **end** (inclusive), and add them to the end of the first string (S1).

All indices are **0-based**.

**Input Format**
The first line contains the first string S1.
The second line contains the second string S2.
The third line contains two integers start and end.

**Constraints**
1 ≤ |S1|, |S2| ≤ 1000 — Here, |S1| means the length of S1
0 ≤ start ≤ end < 1000

**Output Format**
Print the final string formed after adding the selected portion of the second string to the end of the first string.

**Sample Input 0**
hello
world
2 4

**Sample Output 0**
hellorld

**Explanation 0**
Characters of "world" from index 2 to 4 are "rld".
After adding to "hello", the result becomes "hellorld".

**Sample Input 1**
good
morning
1 3

**Sample Output 1**
goodorn

**Explanation 1**
Characters of "morning" from index 1 to 3 are "orn".
Result after adding → "goodorn".
