Problem 79: Print Even Indices
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

Given a number N and an array A of N numbers. Print the numbers in even indices in a reversed order.

Note:
Assume array A is 0-based indexing.
Solve this problem using recursion.

Input
First line contains a number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10³) number of elements.
Second line contains N numbers (−10⁹ ≤ Ai ≤ 10⁹).

Output
Print numbers in even indices in a reversed order separated by spaces.
