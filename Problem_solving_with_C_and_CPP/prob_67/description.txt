**Problem 67: Divisibility by 3**

Given a number of digits N, and a number of N digits, determine whether the number is divisible by 3.

**Note:**
A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.

**Input Format**
The first line will contain N, the number of digits of the number.
The second line will contain the number itself.

**Constraints**
1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁶

**Output Format**
Print **"YES"** (without quotes) if the number is divisible by 3.
Otherwise, print **"NO"**.

**Sample Input 0**
5
12345

**Sample Output 0**
YES

**Explanation 0**
The sum of digits of 12345 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15, which is divisible by 3.
Hence, the number is divisible by 3.

**Sample Input 1**
4
1234

**Sample Output 1**
NO

**Explanation 1**
The sum of digits of 1234 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10, which is not divisible by 3.
Hence, the number is not divisible by 3.
