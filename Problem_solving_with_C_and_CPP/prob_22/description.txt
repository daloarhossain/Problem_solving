Problem 22: Factorial
time limit per test: 2 seconds
memory limit per test: 64 megabytes

Given a number N. Print the factorial of number N.

Input
First line contains a number T (1 ≤ T ≤ 15) — number of test cases.
Next T lines will contain a number N (0 ≤ N ≤ 20).

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the factorial of N.

Example

Input
2
5
3

Output
120
6

Note
Factorial, in mathematics, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given positive integer and denoted by that integer followed by an exclamation point (!).

Thus, factorial seven is written as 7!, meaning 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7 = 5040.
Factorial zero is defined as equal to 1.

In the first test case, for N = 5 → 5! = 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 = 120.
In the second test case, for N = 3 → 3! = 1 × 2 × 3 = 6.
