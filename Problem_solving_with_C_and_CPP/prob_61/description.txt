Problem 61: Way Too Long Words
time limit per test 1 second
memory limit per test 256 megabytes

Given a string S. Print the original string if it's not too long; otherwise, print the special abbreviation.

**Note:**
The string is called *too long* if its length is strictly more than 10 characters.
If the string is too long, then you have to print it in the following manner:

* Print the first character in the string.
* Print the number of characters between the first and the last characters.
* Print the last character in the string.

For example:

* "localization" → "l10n"
* "internationalization" → "i18n"

**Input**
The first line contains a number T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.
Each of the T following lines contains a string S (1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100) where |S| is the length of the string.
It’s guaranteed that S contains only lowercase Latin letters.

**Output**
For each test case, print the result string.

**Example**
