Problem 23: Divisors
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

Given a number N. Print all the divisors of N in ascending order.

Input
Only one line containing a number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁴).

Output
Print all positive divisors of N, one number per line.

Examples

Input
6

Output
1
2
3
6

Input
7

Output
1
7

Input
4

Output
1
2
4

Note
A divisor of a number is a number that divides the integer exactly, with no remainder.
In other words, the division works perfectly with no fractions or remainders involved.

Examples:

3 is a divisor of 12 because 12 ÷ 3 = 4 exactly.

4 is a divisor of 12 because 12 ÷ 4 = 3 exactly.

5 is not a divisor of 12 because 12 ÷ 5 = 2 with a remainder of 2.

A divisor is also known as a factor of the original integer.
