Problem 44: Searching

Time limit per test: 2 seconds
Memory limit per test: 64 megabytes

Description

Given a number N and an array A of N numbers.
Determine if the number X exists in array A or not and print its position (0-index).

Note:

X may appear once, multiple times, or not at all.

You must print the first occurrence of X.

Input

The first line contains a number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁵) — number of elements.
The second line contains N numbers (0 ≤ Ai ≤ 10⁹).
The third line contains a number X (0 ≤ X ≤ 10⁹).

Output

Print the position (0-index) of X the first time you find it.
If it doesn’t exist, print -1.
