**Problem 54: Problem Statement**

You will be given an integer array A of size N. You need to count the number of elements that are divided by 2 and the number of elements that are divided by 3. If any number is divided by both 2 and 3, then consider it only for 2.

**Input Format**
First line will contain N, the size of the array.
Second line will contain the array A.

**Constraints**
1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁵
0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10⁹; here 0 ≤ i < N

**Output Format**
Output the number of elements that are divided by 2 first, then print the number of elements that are divided by 3.

**Sample Input 0**
5
1 4 2 5 3

**Sample Output 0**
2 1

**Sample Input 1**
4
6 9 12 15

**Sample Output 1**
