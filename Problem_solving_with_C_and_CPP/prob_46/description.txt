Problem 46: Positions in Array

**Time limit per test:** 1 second
**Memory limit per test:** 256 megabytes

---

### **Description**

Given a number **N** and an array **A** of **N** numbers.
Print all array positions that store a number **less than or equal to 10**, along with the number stored in that position.

---

### **Input**

The first line contains a number **N (2 ≤ N ≤ 1000)** — number of elements.
The second line contains **N** numbers **(−10⁵ ≤ Ai ≤ 10⁵)**.

It’s guaranteed that there is at least one number in the array less than or equal to 10.

---

### **Output**

For each number in the array that is **equal to or less than 10**, print a single line containing:
A[i] = X
where **i** is the position in the array and **X** is the number stored at that position.

---

### **Example**

**Input**
5
1 2 100 0 30

**Output**
A[0] = 1
A[1] = 2
A[3] = 0
