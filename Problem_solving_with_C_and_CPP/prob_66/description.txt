Problem 66: Good Pairs

Rafi is back with another coding challenge from his big brother Shafi.
This time, Shafi gives him an array of integers and says:

"Pick any 2 numbers from the array to form a pair.
If the pair contains exactly one odd number, it’s a good pair.
But if both numbers are odd or both are Even, it’s not good."

Rafi’s task is to count how many good pairs he can make from the array.
Can you help Rafi solve this challenge and level up his coding skills?

Input Format
The first line contains an integer n, the size of the array (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000).
The second line contains n space-separated integers — the elements of the array (-1000 ≤ a[i] ≤ 1000).

Constraints
2 ≤ n ≤ 1000
-1000 ≤ a[i] ≤ 1000

Output Format
Print a single integer: the number of good pairs.

Sample Input 0
5
1 2 3 4 5

Sample Output 0
6

Explanation 0
All possible pairs:
(1,2) ✅
(1,3) ❌
(1,4) ✅
(1,5) ❌
(2,3) ✅
(2,4) ❌
(2,5) ✅
(3,4) ✅
(3,5) ❌
(4,5) ✅

Total good pairs = 6
