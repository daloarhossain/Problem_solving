Problem 09: Multiples
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes

Statement
You are given two integers A and B.
Print "Multiples" if A is a multiple of B or B is a multiple of A. Otherwise, print "No Multiples".

Input
Only one line containing two integers A and B (1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10⁶)

Output
Print "Multiples" if one of the numbers is a multiple of the other. Otherwise, print "No Multiples".

Examples
Input
9 3
Your output should be:
Multiples

Input
6 24
Your output should be:
Multiples

Input
12 5
Your output should be:
No Multiples

Explanation
In the first example, 9 is divisible by 3, so the answer is Multiples.
In the second example, 6 is not divisible by 24, but 24 is divisible by 6, so the answer is Multiples.
In the third example, neither 12 is divisible by 5 nor 5 by 12, so the answer is No Multiples.
